# Free Bracket Builder

[My Notes](notes.md)

The following application will be a versatile version of a bracket builder. The appeal is to make it free and easy to use as well as adaptable to user needs. Features will include custom themes, access to multiple tourney options (single and double elimination, seeded versus random matchups), and user permissions to specify who can view versus edit in real time. The application will allow the user to manage time with additional inputs: this will allow the user to account for the time it takes to play in a match and how many matches can be played at once. The final product will adapt to both browser and phone templates for viewing.

### Elevator pitch

Free Bracket Builder will be an easy-to-use and quick version of a bracket builder, which will automatically slot participants in a tournament of the user's specifications. Unlike existing applications, this one will be free to use, contain custom themes, and grant unlimited access to typical specifications when creating a tourney (single and double elimination, seeded versus random matchups). The application will boast time management utilities for the user that other apps fail to include, which will account for both the time it takes to play a match as well as how many matches can be played at once. The final product will adapt to both browser and phone templates to be flexible for readers.

    Owner->>Server: Creates and edits bracket, shares it with specified users
    Server-->Editors: Receives bracket
    Server-->Viewers: Receives bracket
    Editors->>Server: Edits bracket
    Server-->Owner: Receives new bracket
    Server-->Viewers: Receives new bracket
```

### Key features

- Secure login over HTTPS
- Determine bracket framework, including title, type, team number, seeds, and other essential elements
- Optional choices for themes, time management components (optional depending on time and resources), and sharing options
- Easy editing for each match for time and location of match
- Sharing options expanded to include co-editors and viewers
- Bracket edits are persistently saved and stored in DB

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Uses HTML structure for application. Four HTML pages: one for login, one for bracket creation, one for bracket structure, and the last containing all brackets the user is shared to.
- **CSS** - Styling for easy usage of bracket creation, choice colors and contrasts used for theme selection. 
- **React** - Login details, interaction with building, editing, and updating the bracket.  
- **Service** - Endpoints for login credentials, send sharing permissions, submitting and retrieving bracket formats and information, API call for theme palettes
- **DB/Login** - Store users, choices, and bracket info in database. Register and login users. Credentials securely stored in database. Can't edit brackets unless authenticated. 
- **WebSocket** - As brackets are created and shared, specified users are granted access. If brackets are made public, then no credentials are needed.
